## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Large Screens**: The drag-and-drop interface works best on larger screens (desktop/laptop)
2. **Touch Devices**: On tablets, you can still use drag-and-drop, though it may be easier to use the traditional dropdown method
3. **Multiple Moves**: You can make multiple drag-and-drop operations in sequence
4. **Undo**: Currently, there's no undo feature, so be careful when moving students/teachers
5. **Refresh**: The page automatically refreshes data after each successful drop

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Escape**: Cancel current drag operation (if supported by browser)
- **Tab**: Navigate between sections

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Drag and drop not working
- **Solution**: Make sure you're clicking and holding, then dragging. Some browsers may require a slight delay before dragging starts.

**Issue**: Drop not registering
- **Solution**: Make sure you're dropping directly onto the class card, not outside it. The blue highlight indicates a valid drop zone.

**Issue**: Changes not saving
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection. Error messages will appear if the operation fails.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Bulk drag operations (select multiple students)
- Drag and drop for attendance marking
- Keyboard navigation for drag and drop
- Touch-optimized gestures for mobile devices
- Drag and drop animations
